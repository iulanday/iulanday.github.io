<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My full name is Isabel Marie Brigid Ulanday. I grew up in a small town in northern NJ about 30 minutes away from the big apple.I have three siblings, an older brother Mark and two younger brothers, Gavin and Dylan. My parents are both immigrants from different countries with unique stories and they somehow both ended up being nurses and merging paths. I am the middle child but most times feel like the eldest or a third parent. I loved my hometown and my friends but decided to branch out in college</p>
<p id="hidden">My college experience is coming to a close at USC after this summer. It has been an experience with lots of growth involed and plenty of unexpected events. It was not my dream school but sometimes what we want is not what we need. I like to believe there is a reason for everything and that my time at uofsc was not all bad. I made a handful of amazing friends, met even more interesting people and tried my best through every experience. </p>

<h2>My Future Career Plans</h2>
<p>I have always been drawn to a career in which I could help people, I wanted to make a personal impact on people in the day to day work of my career. At first I thought this would be through the medical field as I always admired the impact my parents had during their nursing careers.I also had a strong connection to young children and thought I wanted to implement childwork into my career.</p>
<p > When applying to college I was originally a bio major but quickly switched gears after my senior psychology class in Highschool.This class and the teacher opened up my mind to a different career path where I felt I could truly make a personal impact on peoples day to day lives. My goals after these final summer courses are to find an internship and gain work experience for my graduate school applications. I also need to narrow down the discipline I wish to study most post grad as I have many interests in psychology.</p>
